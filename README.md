This repository was forked from Google Code ( http://code.google.com/p/doophp/ ) on December 20, 2013.  After looking at a few light-weight and simple frameworks, we chose this framework as our favorite because it was not so light-weight that it was difficult to understand.  Our primary intentions are to build upon the DooPHP framework.  Possibly adding some new DB drivers, more code generation and some features we have liked or find in other PHP frameworks.

Join us on our journey!
